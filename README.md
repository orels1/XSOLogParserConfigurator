An experimental WinUI 3 based app for configuring XSOverlay Log Parser

WinUI feels pretty great, with hot reload, nice elements and easy debugging.
The main issue is limited featureset and lack some of more classic windows features, like System Tray icons, as well as gigantic installer bundles that have to be shipped as .msix as of right now.

It was interesting to set it all up nonetheless, and I'll probably be using it for some other project in the future.
